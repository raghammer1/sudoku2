# Sudoku Game
This will be a sudoku game...

To run this game please run the main.html in your browser by first downloading the whole repo on you personal laptop,

After that you will get two options one is a solver and other is play Game and this is how each of those work

1. Solver: In this you can feed the game with a custom sudoku by first selecting the number from the bottom numbers panel then click on the board where-ever you want to fill that particular number and then you can keep on doing this with all the numbers. Once you have fed the program with all the data then click the solve button at the bottom and the sudoku solver will give a possible solution for the sudoku you gave it.
If you have filled an incorrect place you can choose E and click on that place at the board to clear that particular place.

2. Play Game: This is a classic play sudoku mode where you will be give a custom grid and then you can play the game like you usually do. To fill number in boxes choose the number you want to fill from the bottom numbers panel and then click on the grid and that particular number will then be filled. If you want to change a number then you can just choose the new number and fill it in again. Then if make a mistake then 1 mistake is added the place with flash red and if you get 5 mistakes then you lose the game. There is a solve option which again can the grid for you, then there is a submit option o submit the final solution, there is a newGame option which will give you a new grid and start a new game basically and finally there is a reset Same option which will reset the same grid for you incase you want to replay or start again with 0 mistakes. Now there is also a hint button which will randomly fill a box on the grid for you. At beginning of each game you have 5 hints which can either be triggered by clicking on hint or clicking on H key on the keyboard, the place where the hint was placed will flash green. Now incase you have reset the same grid then you will only get 1 hint just to make it a bit harder as this is your second try already.


in both game modes for rules you can either press the rules button or you can press R key on your keyboard
